# Allergy-Free Digital Cookbook

## Description of the App

The Allergy-Free Digital Cookbook allows users to input recipes into their account to either keep as a personal cookbook or share with other users. Users will be able to add the difficulty of the recipe, the name, ingredients, steps, and they can check off boxes to indeicate which allergens are not included.

## Technologies Used

- Javascript
- CSS
- Express
- EJS
- MongoDB
- Render.com

### Extras (Maybe)

- I would love to add the feature of Public vs Private. If the user would like to make their recipe public, it will be shown on the Main Show page. If it is made private, it will only be present in their personal cookbook.
- Add the recipe into a specific category: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack, or Dessert. Not only would this split their personal show page into food categories, but if they made the recipe public users could search for the food categories or allergy-free category on the Main Home page.
- Click on the names of the recipes in the index and have the recipe details appear on the other half of the screen.
